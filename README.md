# TODAY-I-LEARNED

This is a web application built in two days. It's a great small project that helped me gain a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of web development. The main part consists of a list of facts. Every fact belongs to one of eight categories listed in a side bar. Users can interact with the facts by voting them using the three available options: interesting, mindblowing or false. If a fact has too many false votes it will be marked as disputed and it might not be true. One can also add a fact and share it with the world by adding the text, the url and the category. The data is real and it comes from a real database hosted by a Supabase server.
